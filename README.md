# :bar_chart: Data Science & Analytics Portfolio

Welcome to my professional portfolio showcasing practical data science and analytics projects focused on extracting actionable insights, building predictive model, and driving data-informed decisions.

## :rocket: Projects

This repository contains notebooks, reports, and code related to my key projects in areas like machine learning, statistical analysis, and business intelligence.

### 1. User Segmentation & Profiling Project Report

This project focuses on applying unsupervised learning techniques (K-Prototypes, that handle numerical and categorical data) to customer data to identify distinct user segments. The goal was to create detailed profiles for each segment, enabling tailored marketing strategies and product development.

- **Key Skills Demonstrated:** Data Cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), K-Prototypes Clustering, Data Visualization, and interpretation of Business Implication.

- **Technologies:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

- Access the full project report [here](./User%20Segmentation%20&%20Profiling%20Project%20Report.md).

### 2. User Segmentation & User Profiling Using Hierarchical Clustering

This project represents an improved and refined approach to user analysis, building upon the foundational segmentation. It focuses on maximizing insight depth through advanced data preparation and a different clustering methodology.

- **Core Improvement Techniques:** Utilized Feature Engineering to create more robust input variables, leveraged Feature Importance to select the most impactful attributes, and implemented Hierarchical Clustering to uncover natural, nested relationships among user groups.

- **Key Skills Demonstrated:** Feature Engineering (custom transformations), Feature Selection/Importance, Hierarchical/Agglomerative Clustering, Dendrogram Analysis, Cluster Validation, Model Iteration.

- **Technologies:** Python, pandas, scikit-learn, SciPy (for hierarchical methods).

- Access the full project report [here](./User%20Segmentation%20&%20User%20Profiling%20Using%20Hierarchical%20Clustering.md).

### 3. User Topic Recommendation Model (In progress)

Building directly on the user segments identified in projects 1 and 2, this next phase focuses on developing a predictive model to recommend personalized content or topics to each user. The model uses the **same underlying dataset**, leveraging behavioral patterns and segment characteristics to anticipate individual user interests and improve overall platform engagement.
